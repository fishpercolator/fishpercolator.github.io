# Fish Percolator website

This is the new Fish Percolator website - a one-page Jekyll site based on [Biscuit](http://sblisesivdin.github.io/biscuit).

The old website's source code is still here at [fishpercolator/fpsite](https://github.com/fishpercolator/fpsite.git) but it is no longer maintained.
